This is a simple plugin made in [Union](https://worldofplayers.ru/threads/40376/) **1.0k** for Gothic 1 and 2. Plugin was created mainly for testing and learning purposes.

### Features

* Essentially plugin changes name color of focused npcs, containers and doors.
  - Npcs: `Red - hostile / wants to kill you`, `Orange - angry / pissed off`, `Green - friendly`, `White - neutral / dead`, `Grey - dead and looted`.
  - Doors: `Red - locked on key`, `Orange - locked`, `White - open`.
  - Chests: `Red - locked on key`, `Orange - locked`, `Green - open with items`, `Grey - open and empty`.
  - Each group can be disabled separately in `gothic.ini` with `bColorNpcs`, `bColorChests` and `bColorDoors` options.

* Also on debug build prints info on the screen about plugin and platform.
