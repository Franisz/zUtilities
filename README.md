### Features

> Plugin options can be changed in `gothic.ini`.

> Some of the options can also be changed via ingame menu. (Requires Union 1.0m or higher.)

- Quickly save / load game with `F10` and `F12` keys.

  - Shortcuts can be changed with `KeyQuickSave` and `KeyQuickLoad` options. A full list of available keys to choose from is [there](https://github.com/Franisz/zUtilities/blob/master/zUtilities/KeyCode.h).
  - Range of save slots used for quick save can be adjusted in `gothic.ini` with `MinSaveSlot`, `MaxSaveSlot` options. Default, it's 6 bottom slots.

  - This feature can be disabled in `gothic.ini` with `QuickSaveMode` option.

  - Game can also be quick loaded from main menu by pressing `KeyQuickLoad`.
  - Save can be automatically loaded after game start when `QuickLoadAfterGameStart` is set to `1`.

- Changes name color of focused npcs, containers, doors and items.

  - Npcs: `Red` - hostile / wants to kill you, `Orange` - angry / pissed off, `Cyan` - partymember, `Green` - friendly, `Slightly green` - friendly guild, `White` - neutral / dead, `Grey` - dead and looted.
  - Lockables: `Red` - locked on key, `Orange` - locked, `Light red` - can be opened with a key or lockpick, `Green` - open with items, `Grey` - permanently closed or opened and empty.

  - Each group can be disabled separately in `gothic.ini` with `ColorNpcs`, `ColorLockables`, `ColorItems` and `ColorInter` options.

- Renders the selected inventory item in the center of the screen instead of in the item description box.

  - Camera in inventory will be shifted a bit, so the item doesn't cover the hero.
  - In Gothic 2 item will be animated only if item has `inv_animate` property set to true.
  - In Gothic 1 item will be displayed on the left or right when trading.
  - This feature can be disabled in `gothic.ini` with `CenterInvItems` option.

- Renders labels for items in the inventory based on item parameters.

  - All icons are made via [Game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net/) website.
  - There are many possible icons to appear when item has right parameters. There are labels even for items that don't exist in original game like shields, helmets, armors requiring attribute and more.
  - Label can be set to render behind item model, so it doesn't cover it. Set `PutLabelBehind` option to `1` in order to do that.

  - Label scale can be adjusted in `gothic.ini` with `LabelScale` option.
  - This feature can be disabled in `gothic.ini` with `LabelItems` option.

- Displays a popup when dealing damage.

  - This feature is inspired by [New World](https://www.newworld.com/)'s damage label and based on [AlterDamage](https://github.com/UnresolvedExternal/Union_AlterDamage) popup code.
  - Set `DamagePopupMode` option to `1` for _Alter Damage_ style, `2` for _New World_ style and `0` to disable this feature completely.
  - Popup scale depends on the amount of damage dealt compared to the target's max hp, the fact if the hit was critical or not and `Scale` option from `SystemPack.ini`. Base scale can also be adjusted in `gothic.ini` with `DamagePopupScale`.
  - Icons and base colors are unique for every damage type and each can be separately disabled in `gothic.ini` with `DamagePopupShowIcons` and, `DamagePopupColorDmgTypes` options.
